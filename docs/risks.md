### 1. The "Security" Risk (The Howey Test)

In the U.S., the SEC looks at tokens to see if they are "Securities." If you promise drivers that $CANDLE will "go to the moon" or that they are "investing" in your company, you are in the danger zone.

* **The Fix:** Always frame $CANDLE as a **Utility/Reward**. It is a "Rebate Program" or "Loyalty Point," similar to airline miles or credit card points.
* **The Rule:** Don't sell the token to them as an investment. They *earn* it by using your service.

### 2. The "Custody" Risk (Holding the Crypto)

When you hold someone else's money or crypto, you are technically a **"Custodian."** In some states (and federally), this can trigger "Money Transmitter" laws (MTL), which require expensive licenses.

* **The Fix (The "Casino Chip" Model):** This is why we discussed the database model.
* If you hold the actual keys to their private wallets, you are a custodian.
* If you hold the tokens in a **Master Vault** and simply "promise" to pay them out later via a third-party (like **UPay**), you are operating more like a rewards program (like Starbucks Stars).


* **The Pro Move:** Using **UPay** is your best shield. By having the driver set up their *own* account with a licensed provider (UPay), you shift the "Money Handling" legal burden onto UPay. You just send the tokens; they handle the banking.

### 3. The 6-Month Lock (Contractual Clarity)

Is it legal to lock someone’s rewards? Yes—as long as it’s in the contract they sign when they join.

* **The Fix:** Your **Terms of Service (TOS)** must be ironclad. It should state: *"The 2% fee is a non-refundable service fee. The $CANDLE rebate is a discretionary loyalty reward subject to a 180-day vesting period."*

### 4. Trucking Regulations (Bona Fide Transparency)

Since you are acting as an AI Dispatcher, you need to ensure you aren't accidentally acting as an **unlicensed broker**.

* **The Fix:** Ensure your AI is a **tool for the carrier**. The driver/carrier should still be the one "signing" the rate confirmation (even if it's just a one-tap "Accept" in your app). This keeps the legal relationship between the Carrier and the Broker, with you as the "Software Provider."

### **Should you be "worried"?**

Don't be worried, be **prepared**.

**The Three Pillars of Protection:**

1. **Form an Entity:** You mentioned a Delaware C-Corp for *ClosingPitch*. Do the same (or an LLC) for *Green Candle Dispatch*. Never do this as an individual; protect your personal assets.
2. **The "UPay" Shield:** Let them be the regulated financial bridge. You stay as the software/AI guy.
3. **No "Guaranteed Profit" Language:** Never use words like "invest," "profit," or "guaranteed returns." Use "rebate," "reward," "stash," and "savings."

### **What I would do next:**

Once you have your first few test drivers, spend a few hundred bucks to have a **crypto-knowledgeable attorney** look over your Terms of Service. It's the best insurance you'll ever buy.
