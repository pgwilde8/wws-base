Green Candle Dispatch (GCD) — Revenue Model and System Economics
Prepared by: Green Candle Dispatch
Entity: Webwise Systems Inc. (Delaware C-Corp)

Executive Summary
Green Candle Dispatch is an autonomous AI dispatch infrastructure platform that replaces traditional human dispatchers with software agents.
The platform earns revenue primarily from a 2% dispatch service fee collected through factoring partners, supplemented by factoring partner referral revenue, call service products, and optional premium automation services.
A portion of dispatch fee revenue is optionally issued back to drivers as internal service credits denominated in CANDLE, which are used exclusively within the platform to access automation features.
This model aligns platform sustainability, driver success, and system growth.

Primary Revenue Stream: 2% Dispatch Service Fee
Green Candle Dispatch earns a flat 2% dispatch service fee only after a driver successfully completes a load and receives payment through a factoring partner.
Example Load:
Broker pays: $1,900
Factoring company fee (3%): $57
Green Candle Dispatch fee (2%): $38
Driver receives: $1,805
The platform earns revenue only from successful outcomes.
There are no upfront dispatch fees and no monthly subscription required for core dispatch automation.

Dispatch Fee Allocation Model
Each dispatch fee is allocated to support system operation, sustainability, and driver automation access.
Example: $38 Dispatch Fee Allocation
$15 → Infrastructure Costs
• AI processing (OpenAI services where applicable)
• Server hosting and backend infrastructure
• Email automation infrastructure
• Data storage and system monitoring
$10 → Platform Operating Margin
• Company operating revenue
• Development and engineering
• Customer support
• Business operations
$13 → Internal Service Credit Issuance (CANDLE Credits)
• Issued to driver internal account ledger
• Used exclusively to access dispatch automation features
• Non-transferable, service-based utility credits

Driver Dashboard Representation
Drivers see transparent dispatch economics inside the platform dashboard.
Example Driver Dashboard Entry:
Load completed: $1,900
Dispatch fee: $38
Service credits issued: 13 CANDLE
These credits can be used to:
• Run automated dispatch agents
• Initiate broker negotiation automation
• Access advanced automation features
• Enable premium automation workflows
Credits represent internal service access, not external payments.

Factoring Partner Referral Revenue
Green Candle Dispatch receives additional referral revenue from factoring partners.
Typical factoring partner referral revenue ranges from:
0.25% to 0.75% of invoice value
Example Load:
Invoice: $1,900
Partner referral fee (0.35%): $6.65 additional revenue
This revenue is separate from the 2% dispatch service fee.
Drivers who already use one factoring partner may be offered alternative approved partners to maximize service compatibility and platform integration efficiency.
This allows Green Candle Dispatch to capture referral revenue while improving automation reliability.

Call Automation Revenue (Twilio Call Products)
Broker communication often requires phone calls, which incur direct telecommunications costs.
Green Candle Dispatch provides call capability through prepaid call service products.
Call automation is not included in the base 2% dispatch service.
Drivers purchase call packages as

You’re now at the point where you need to see actual revenue math per load, per driver, and per month so you know exactly what Green Candle can generate. I’ll break it down realistically using your real flows.
We’ll calculate:
revenue per load
revenue per driver per month
revenue at scale (100, 500, 1,000 drivers)
plus additional streams (factor partner, Twilio packs, broker DB, etc.)

Core revenue stream: 2% dispatch fee from factoring
Example load value: $1,900
Factor takes 3%: $57
You receive 2%: $38
This is your primary revenue engine.
Now split that $38 realistically:
Example internal allocation:
$12 → platform profit
$10 → treasury ($CANDLE backing)
$8 → AI infrastructure reserve
$8 → driver service credits (internal CANDLE credits)
You still net $12 real profit per load immediately, plus treasury growth.

Now calculate real driver behavior
Realistic average owner-operator:
12–20 loads per month
We’ll use conservative: 15 loads per month
Revenue per driver per month:
15 loads × $38 = $570/month gross revenue per driver
Your direct profit portion:
15 × $12 = $180/month profit per driver
Plus treasury growth:
15 × $10 = $150/month treasury accumulation per driver

Now scale scenarios
100 drivers
Gross revenue:
100 × $570 = $57,000/month
Direct profit:
100 × $180 = $18,000/month
Treasury accumulation:
100 × $150 = $15,000/month

500 drivers
Gross revenue:
500 × $570 = $285,000/month
Direct profit:
500 × $180 = $90,000/month
Treasury accumulation:
500 × $150 = $75,000/month

1,000 drivers
Gross revenue:
1,000 × $570 = $570,000/month
Direct profit:
1,000 × $180 = $180,000/month
Treasury accumulation:
1,000 × $150 = $150,000/month
This is real infrastructure-level revenue.

Second revenue stream: factoring partner referral fees
Factoring companies often pay:
0.25% – 0.75% referral override
Using conservative 0.35%:
Example $1,900 load:
0.35% = $6.65 extra revenue
Monthly per driver:
15 loads × $6.65 = $99/month extra revenue
At 1,000 drivers:
$99,000/month extra
Pure profit.

Third revenue stream: Twilio call packages
Example average driver uses:
120 call minutes/month
Sell call pack:
$99/month call pack
Your cost:
120 × $0.015 = $1.80 Twilio cost
Profit:
~$97/month per driver
At 500 drivers:
$48,500/month profit
This is massive margin.

Fourth revenue stream: premium automation credits
Drivers buy extra credits:
Example:
Average driver buys $50/month extra credits
At 500 drivers:
$25,000/month additional revenue
Cost near zero.

Fifth revenue stream: broker priority placement
Brokers pay:
$99–$299/month
Even 200 brokers at $149/month:
$29,800/month revenue

Combined realistic revenue example at 500 drivers
Dispatch fees profit: $90,000
Factor partner revenue: $49,500
Call pack profit: $48,500
Credit purchases: $25,000
Broker subscriptions: $29,800
Total monthly profit:
$242,800/month
Treasury accumulation separate:
$75,000/month treasury growth

Annual projection at 500 drivers
Profit:
$242,800 × 12 = $2.9 million/year
Treasury accumulation:
$75,000 × 12 = $900,000/year treasury growth

Your biggest advantage: your broker DB reduces cost and increases success rate
Because your agents contact brokers directly from your DB:
Higher load capture rate
Lower acquisition cost
Higher driver retention
This compounds revenue.

Realistic launch scenario: first 90 days
Month 1: 25 drivers → ~$4,500 profit
Month 2: 75 drivers → ~$13,500 profit
Month 3: 150 drivers → ~$27,000 profit
Momentum grows naturally.

Most important insight
Your dispatch fee revenue alone makes this viable.
Everything else (call packs, factor override, credits, broker subscriptions) multiplies revenue.
You are building infrastructure, not just a dispatch tool.

If you want, I can also show the minimum number of drivers needed to reach $10k/month profit, which is the real survival threshold.
==========
That’s a strong advantage: your own broker directory turns this from “AI helper” into a real dispatch network. It also lets you control costs and make $CANDLE utility real (and fair).
Here’s how to handle both parts: broker phone calls (Twilio hard cost) and your broker DB (unique asset).

1) Broker phone calls: yes, Twilio is a hard cost — so price it separately
Don’t bury phone calling inside “free” automation. Make it an explicit paid action (USD or CANDLE), and keep margins clear.
Practical rule
Email/SMS automation: cheap → can be included or low CANDLE cost
Phone calls: real cost → metered and charged per minute
Recommended pricing model
CANDLE for initiation + per-minute billing
Example: 0.5 CANDLE to initiate a broker call
Plus $0.25–$0.45 per minute (or equivalent in CANDLE at your fixed internal rate)
Or simplest:
Phone calls are always USD pass-through + margin, credits optional for convenience
Why: drivers understand calls cost money.
Safety valve
Set a monthly call cap per driver unless they buy a call pack. This prevents one user from burning your Twilio budget.

2) Turn Twilio calling into a “Call Pack” product (very clean revenue)
Offer pre-paid call minutes (like cell plans).
Example packs:
$49 → 120 call minutes
$99 → 300 call minutes
$199 → 750 call minutes
You can also denominate as internal “Call Minutes Credits” (separate from CANDLE dispatch credits).
This keeps accounting clean:
CANDLE = dispatch automation authority/credits
Call packs = Twilio minutes (hard cost)

3) Your broker database is the real moat — monetize access and outcomes
Having 25k+ brokers/freight movers with MC/DOT, emails, and phones means:
faster outreach
higher connection rate
fewer dead leads
ability to score brokers
This is a real product layer.
Immediate features you can build (high value)
Broker “one-click contact”
Driver sees load → click → your system selects best channel (email/phone)
Broker profile + score
Response rate, average time to reply, pay history notes (even simple flags)
Auto packet send
One click sends carrier packet + insurance + W-9 + NOA (if needed)
Charge CANDLE for those “execution” actions.

4) Best way to use your DB with the agent
You already described it perfectly:
Agent only needs:
MC number + load details
Backend resolves:
emails, phone, preferred contact method
broker name, notes, templates
compliance checklist
Architecture pattern
Extension finds load + broker MC
Calls FastAPI: POST /agent/opportunity
FastAPI looks up broker in Postgres
Agent chooses action plan:
email first → if no response in X minutes → call
if “call required” broker → call immediately
This is exactly how you build scale.

5) Make CANDLE utility real using your DB
Here are concrete, credible CANDLE-gated actions that match your reality:
Low-cost actions (extension-driven)
Advanced filters (lane + min rate + broker score) → 1 CANDLE/day
“Top 20 best loads today” ranking using your broker DB score → 1 CANDLE/day
High-value actions (your backend executes)
“Send bid email + follow-up sequence” → 0.5 CANDLE
“Auto packet send + invoice template attached” → 1 CANDLE
“Escalate to phone call workflow” → 0.5 CANDLE + call minutes
Outcome-based (best for adoption)
“Autonomous dispatch mode (email-only)” → 3 CANDLE per booked load
“Autonomous dispatch mode (email + call)” → 5 CANDLE per booked load + call minutes
This is clean because you charge for results.

6) How to keep your Twilio costs safe
Do these three things from day one:
Call budget per driver
“Included 30 minutes/month” OR “No included minutes”
Require approval toggle
“Agent may call brokers automatically” (off by default)
Call attempt limits
Max 2 call attempts per load unless driver confirms
This prevents runaway costs.

7) New revenue streams unlocked by your broker DB
You can sell:
Broker directory access (dispatchers, carriers): $49–$199/mo
Broker verification reports: $5 per broker
Broker contact enrichment for other dispatchers: usage-based
Even without tokens, this is a product.

8) Next step: pick 1 simple paid call model and 1 CANDLE utility model
If you want the cleanest launch:
Calls: sell call packs (USD)
CANDLE: charge per booked load (outcome-based) + per automation sequence
That’s easiest to explain and hardest to abuse.

If you tell me roughly:
your expected average call minutes per booked load (2? 5? 10?)
and how often brokers demand calls vs email (like 30%? 60%?)
…I’ll propose exact pack pricing + CANDLE action pricing so your margins stay strong.
