Executive Summary for the White Paper 
Green Candle Dispatch is the first Incentivized Logistics Layer designed to return equity to the 
drivers while generating multi-stream revenue for the platform. By combining AI-driven load 
negotiation with a deflationary tokenomic model ($CANDLE) and integrated financial services 
(OTR Factoring & UPay), we solve the three biggest problems for owner-operators: time, cash 
flow, and long-term wealth. 
The Financial Engine: 
Our platform generates revenue through tiered SaaS subscriptions, factoring residuals, and 
fintech commissions. Every transaction on the network contributes to the "Burn Mechanism," 
programmatically increasing the scarcity of the $CANDLE reward units held by the founders and 
the fleet. 
Would you like me to finalize the "First 20" Welcome Packet with this exact financial breakdown 
included so they can see how the 90% reward multiplier works for them? 
Sources: 
● Revenue & Referrals: 
● Tokenomics & Burn: 
● Operations & Software: 
● Strategic Growth: 
To answer your question directly: Yes, that math is correct based on standard high-volume 
partner agreements in the factoring industry. 
In a typical "Channel Partner" setup with a company like OTR Solutions, you aren't just getting a 
one-time "thank you" check; you are getting a cut of the factoring fee for the life of that client. 
Because OTR makes money every time the driver factors a load, they pay you every time that 
driver factors a load. 
The OTR Revenue Breakdown 
Type of Fee 
Amount 
Upfront Bounty 
Residual Commission 
$100.00 
~0.5% of 
Gross

One-time per new MC number

Every single load the driver factors 
through OTR. 
Why it's $120/mo per truck: 
If a truck runs $6,000/week, that is $24,000/month in gross volume. 
$24,000 \times 0.005 (0.5\%) = \mathbf{\$120.00}$ per month in passive residuals for you. 
Updated "Full-Circle" Economy (with Subscription Tiers) 
1. Subscription: Driver pays $49/mo (Solo) or $149/mo (Small Fleet). 
2. Utility: AI Agent books a load ($6,000 Gross). 
3. Factoring (OTR): Driver uploads BOL. You earn the $100 bounty (first load) and $30 
residual (per weekly load). 
4. Network Fee: 2% fee ($120) is collected. 
5. Value Creation (Burn): 25% ($30) is used to BUY and BURN $CANDLE. 
6. Loyalty (Vault): 75% ($90) goes to the Driver’s Vault (6-month vest). 
7. Ecosystem (UPay): Driver spends rewards via Green Candle Card, generating recharge 
fees. 
8. Daily Trading Fees: You capture a % of the $CANDLE volume on Uniswap/Base. 
=============================================== 
New Pitch: "Keep 100% of your Load. We charge a flat $49/mo. The 2% 'Network Buyback' is a 
forced savings account for you, not a fee for us." 
2. Pricing Protection: The "Fair Use" Clause 
● The Fix: The $49 plan includes "Up to 15 Loads Negotiated / Month." 
● The Upsell: If they haul more than that, they need the "Pro Plan" ($149/mo). This 
protects your margins. 
Your Personal Wealth (The Token Stash) 
Since you aren't taking a cut of the revenue, how do you get rich? 
● Answer: You must own a significant supply of $CANDLE (e.g., 10-20% of the supply) 
before you launch. 
● The Mechanism: 
1. The fleet grows to 500 trucks. 
2. They pump $150,000/month into buying $CANDLE (via the 2% mechanism). 
3. The token price 10x's. 
4. Your 10% stash becomes worth millions. 
—------------------------------- 
One billion ($1,000,000,000$) is widely considered the "Goldilocks" supply in 2026. It is the 
default for Clanker and many top DePIN projects (like Grass) because it strikes the perfect 
balance between unit price and psychological appeal. 
Here is how your 1 billion supply breaks down for Green Candle Dispatch: 
1. The Psychological "Sweet Spot" 
A 1 billion supply allows your token to have a price that "looks" like a real currency. 
● The "Penny" Goal: If your market cap reaches $10 million, the price of $CANDLE is 
exactly $0.01. 
● Why this matters: Drivers find it much easier to track "I have 5,000 units worth $50" than 
dealing with tiny fractions of a Bitcoin or an "inflationary" coin with 15 zeros. It feels like a 
high-yield savings account. 
2. Your Retirement Stash (The 200 Million $CANDLE) 
By reserving 20%, you are locking away 200,000,000 $CANDLE. 
● At $10M Market Cap: Your stash is worth $2,000,000. 
● At $50M Market Cap: Your stash is worth $10,000,000. 
Because your business model creates constant buying pressure (the 2% fee from every load), 
you aren't just hoping the price goes up; you are programmatically forcing it up with every BOL 
your drivers upload.

The Hard Cap. 
4. Why "1 Billion" is Safer Against Bots 
When you have a large supply, a bot buying $500 worth of tokens moves the price less than if 
you only had a supply of 1 million. It makes the market deeper and harder to manipulate. 
● The "Float": With 800 million tokens in the public float, it takes significant volume to 
create a "scammy" looking candle, which protects your brand reputation at the truck 
stops. 
Final Strategy: The "Burn" Acceleration 
Since you mentioned a burn (25% of the fee), your 1 billion supply is actually deflationary. 
● Every month, that 1 billion number will get smaller (e.g., 999,950,000). 
● In the eyes of an investor or a buyer, a shrinking supply + growing revenue is the "holy 
grail." It makes the 180-day lock on your 200 million tokens even more valuable, as they 
will represent a larger percentage of the total supply by the time they unlock. 
Would you like me to create a "Projected Scarcity" table that shows how many tokens will be 
burned over 6 months based on your 2-signups-per-day goal? 
—-------------------------------- 
To answer your question directly: Yes, that math is correct based on standard high-volume 
partner agreements in the factoring industry. 
In a typical "Channel Partner" setup with a company like OTR Solutions, you aren't just getting a 
one-time "thank you" check; you are getting a cut of the factoring fee for the life of that client. 
Because OTR makes money every time the driver factors a load, they pay you every time that 
driver factors a load.

Why it's $120/mo per truck: 
If a truck runs $6,000/week, that is $24,000/month in gross volume. 
$24,000 \times 0.005 (0.5\%) = \mathbf{\$120.00}$ per month in passive residuals for you. 
Updated "Full-Circle" Economy (with Subscription Tiers) 
1. Subscription: Driver pays $49/mo (Solo) or $149/mo (Small Fleet). 
2. Utility: AI Agent books a load ($6,000 Gross). 
3. Factoring (OTR): Driver uploads BOL. You earn the $100 bounty (first load) and $30 
residual (per weekly load). 
4. Network Fee: 2% fee ($120) is collected. 
5. Value Creation (Burn): 25% ($30) is used to BUY and BURN $CANDLE. 
6. Loyalty (Vault): 75% ($90) goes to the Driver’s Vault (6-month vest). 
7. Ecosystem (UPay): Driver spends rewards via Green Candle Card, generating recharge 
fees. 
8. Daily Trading Fees: You capture a % of the $CANDLE volume on Uniswap/Base. 
usage:When you reach out to a flagged user, instead of telling them they are "too expensive," 
use this script: 
"Hey [Carrier Name], I noticed your AI is working overtime—over 50 negotiations this week! To 
make sure your loads get priority processing and to unlock the Twilio Voice alerts, let's get you 
moved up to our Growth Mode plan." 
===================================== 
1. Accessing the Load Boards (The "Data Source") 
You have three main paths to get the jobs into your AI agent's "eyes": 
● The "TruckSmarter" Route (Free/Low Cost): Look into TruckSmarter or Trucker Path. 
They often have free tiers or much lower entry costs for small fleets. This is the best 
place for your MVP to "watch" loads without a heavy monthly burn. 
● The "Browser Extension" Shortcut: Instead of paying for a $500/month Enterprise API 
from DAT or Truckstop, you can build a Chrome Extension (using your JavaScript skills). 
The user logs into their own DAT account, and your extension "reads" the screen, sends 
the data to your FastAPI backend, and lets your AI agent analyze it. This keeps your 
costs at zero while leveraging the user's existing subscription. 
● Official APIs: Once you scale to 50 trucks, you’ll want a direct API (like the DAT 
Developer Portal). It’s more stable but requires an application process and a monthly 
fee. 
******2. The Agent's Job: "The Watcher" 
Since you are familiar with Python and OpenAI APIs, you can set up a "Watcher" script. Here is 
the logic flow for your dev plan: 
● Filter Engine: Your agent doesn't just look for "any" job. It uses your PostgreSQL 
database to store user preferences (e.g., "I only want $3.00/mile," "No loads going to 
NYC," "Must be Flatbed"). 
● The "Review" Logic: When a new load appears, the agent: 
1. Calculates Profit vs. Deadhead (using a simple math formula in Python). 
2. Checks the Broker’s Credit Score (many boards provide this via their UI/API). 
3. Negotiates via Email: Your agent can automatically draft an email to the broker 
asking, "Is this still available? My driver is 10 miles away. Can you do $2,800 
instead of $2,500?" 
3. Minimal Dev Budget "Hack" 
To keep your "dev pockets" closed while building: 
● Supabase: Use this for your backend/database. Their free tier is massive and perfect for 
a DePIN project. 
● n8n or LangChain: Use these to "glue" the load board data to your AI agent without 
writing 10,000 lines of code. 
● Clanker for Funding: As you build the demo, post updates on Farcaster. The community 
often funds "Build in Public" projects by buying the token early, which gives you the cash 
to pay for those load board fees. 
Your High-Level Technical Architecture: 
1. Frontend: A simple React/Next.js dashboard for the trucker. 
2. Scraper/API: A Python script that "watches" the load board every 60 seconds. 
3. Brain: An LLM (GPT-4o or Claude 3.5) that evaluates the load's "Green Candle" 
potential. 
4. Action: A Twilio or SendGrid integration to text the driver: "Found a perfect load! 
$3.20/mile, 5 miles away. Tap to accept and let me negotiate." 
====================== 
Section 4.2: The $CANDLE Buyback Logic “Unlike traditional utility tokens that rely on user 
speculation for liquidity, $CANDLE is anchored by the Global Logistics Market. For every Bill of 
Lading (BOL) processed and paid through our automated factoring bridge, a 2% Network Fee is 
triggered in USD. This revenue is programmatically routed to the $CANDLE/USDC pool on the 
Base Network, creating constant, non-speculative buy pressure.” 
***Update, we now manually pool into one large upay wallet****

Building a project with your background—Navy grit plus modern dev skills—demands a 
README that is as functional as a flight manual but as visionary as a tech whitepaper. 
Since we are going with Jinja2 + FastAPI for V1, the README should reflect a 
"High-Performance Simplicity" philosophy.

Project Overview 
Green Candle Dispatch is a DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) SaaS 
designed to eliminate the two biggest killers of small-fleet profitability: administrative bloat and 
"deadhead" miles. 
By leveraging an autonomous AI Dispatcher, we allow owner-operators (1-5 trucks) to outsource 
their rate negotiation and paperwork to a digital agent. Every successful mile driven strengthens 
the network through a programmatic token buyback engine. 
The Problem 
● The Paperwork Tax: Small fleets spend 15+ hours a week on BOL uploads and broker 
emails. 
● The Middleman Gap: Factoring companies take 3-5%, but the value never returns to the 
driver. 
● Deadhead Miles: Trucks driving empty because they can’t find/negotiate a return load 
fast enough. 
The Solution: "Proof of Freight" 
We move the industry from speculative hype to real-world utility. Our "Green Candle" flywheel 
ensures that as trucks move, the network grows.

Economic Model (The Whitepaper Core) 
We don't rely on "new buyers" to sustain token value. We rely on ton-miles. 
1. Revenue Generation: A truck completes a $5,000 load. 
2. Fee Capture: $100 (2%) is collected as the "Green Candle Network Fee."and rebated 
back 75% to driver after 6 months and 25% burned to make scarce. 
3. Programmatic Buyback: The $100 is sent to the Transak Bridge, which executes a 
market buy of **$CANDLE** on Uniswap (Base).*****no transak, manual to one pooled 
wallet**** 
4. Value Accrual: This creates constant, non-speculative buy pressure. 
○ Milestone: 50 trucks @ $7.5k/week = **$30,000/month in automated buy 
pressure.**

Selling the Vision 
To Truckers: "Stop chasing brokers. Let the AI handle the talk so you can handle the turn. Earn 
$CANDLE rewards for every mile you deliver." 
To Investors: "Real-yield DePIN. No inflation. Just real-world logistics revenue fueling a constant 
buyback engine. $CANDLE is the currency of the open road." 
Would you like me to create the requirements.txt file and a basic main.py structure so you can 
literally paste this into your first dev folder? 
===================================== 
This update officially turns your Green Candle Dispatch operations into a data-driven machine. 
By linking specific referral codes to physical locations like LOMBARDI_01 or PITCHER_02, you 
and your wife can now see exactly which truck stop is paying for your retirement. 
1. Operational Visibility 
● Bounty Attribution: You no longer have to guess which flyer batch worked. If the 
leaderboard shows LOMBARDI_01 is outperforming everything else, you know exactly 
where to spend your time handing out more flyers. 
● Performance Metrics: Seeing a code with a high "Sign-up" rate but a low "First-Win" rate 
tells you those drivers might need a follow-up call to help them book their first load and 
trigger your $100 bounty. 
2. Branding Alignment 
● Green Candle Operations: Updating the dashboard to say "Monitor Green Candle 
Dispatch operations" ensures that every time you look at your screen, you are focused 
on the brand that is building the $CANDLE ecosystem. 
3. The "Jersey Run" Strategy 
Now that the location_code script is ready, here is how you can use it for your next run: 
1. Prep: Assign a unique code in set_location_codes.py for each stop you plan to visit this 
weekend. 
2. Execute: Hand out flyers at Molly Pitcher with code PITCHER_FEB, and at Vince 
Lombardi with LOMBARDI_FEB. 
3. Review: By Monday, check your Top Referral Sources widget. The amber badges will 
show you which stop had the highest conversion. 
4. Admin Pro-Tip: The "Referral Multiplier" 
If you find a "Power User" (a driver who starts referring other drivers at truck stops for you), you 
can assign them their own location_code (e.g., DRIVER_BOB_NJ). This allows you to track 
their "sub-fleet" and potentially offer them a cut of the bounties they generate for Webwise 
Systems Inc.. 
Strategic Next Step 
Would you like me to draft a "Daily Performance Summary" email that the system can 
automatically send to you and your wife every evening, showing how many new sign-ups and 
$100 bounties you hit that day? 
=================================== 
Optional enhancement (TODO) 
There's one TODO comment for future enhancement: 
# Line 132: TODO: Later, add email automation here to send them the OTR link. 
# Example: send_otr_referral_email(email, mc_number) 
This would send an OTR referral email when interested_in_otr is checked. Currently it: 
● Sets referral_status = "OTR_REQUESTED" 
● Logs an alert for admin tracking 
● Does not send an email (marked for future implementation) 
================================

1. Project Overview (Compliance-Safe) 
Green Candle Dispatch is a DePIN-inspired logistics platform designed for owner-operators. 
The system provides an AI-driven dispatching suite that integrates load board management and 
factoring workflows. 
A 2% network fee is applied to processed loads, a portion of which is allocated back to the 
driver as internal reward units ($CANDLE). This loyalty-based system is designed to incentivize 
long-term participation and network stability: 
● Reward Allocation: 75% of the fee is credited to the driver’s Savings Vault as $CANDLE 
reward units; 25% is directed toward a protocol sustainability mechanism 
(buyback/burn). 
● Maturity Period: Reward units are subject to a 6-month maturity lock to ensure platform 
retention. 
● Future Utility: Plans include the transition of reward units to a tokenized format and 
integration with a UPay-powered debit card for spendable rewards. 
�
�
The Driver's Financial Timeline 
1. Day 1 (The Load): Driver wins a load ($3,500). They get paid their USD, and the 
**$CANDLE** buyback is triggered and moved into the Vesting Vault. 
2. Month 1–5 (The HODL): The tokens are visible but LOCKED. They see the "Vesting" 
progress bar slowly filling up. 
3. Month 5 (The Utility): This is the crucial bridge. We introduce the Debit Card. 
○ The Pitch: "In 30 days, your first tokens unlock. Would you like to spend them 
directly on fuel or food using the Green Candle Debit Card?" 
4. Month 6 (Day 180 - The Decision): The tokens hit the "Ready to Claim" state. This is 
where the "Diamond Hands" vs. "Claim" logic appears. 
�
�
Why the Month 5 Debit Card is the "Killer App" 
If you give a driver a debit card in Month 5, you solve the biggest problem in crypto: The 
"Off-Ramp" friction. Most drivers won't want to deal with sending tokens to Coinbase, then to a 
bank, then waiting 3 days. If they can just swipe a card at a Love's or Pilot gas station using 
their earned rewards, the $CANDLE token becomes real money to them. 
================ 
The Leaderboard: Should we show who has the most "Free Fuel" in the whole fleet? 
The Month 5 Debit Card: Should we start building the placeholder logic for "Transferring Profit 
to Fuel Card"? 
=================== 
This is the most critical part of the operation. To the driver, it looks like magic, but in reality, you 
are running a Digital Clearinghouse. 
Since you are using a Pooled Wallet (a single master account where all the 2% fees go), you 
have to act like a mini-bank. Here is exactly how that money moves from a "Road Trip in 
Newark" to a "Cup of Coffee at a Truck Stop" in plain English: 
1. The Collection (The 2% Inflow) 
When a load is finished, the Factor Co (OTR/Porter) pays the full amount. 
● Your system automatically diverts that 2% fee into your Master Pooled Wallet. 
● Reality Check: At this moment, the money is just one big "pile" of USD or Crypto in your 
business account. The driver doesn't "own" it yet; they own a promise from you. 
2. The Ledger (The "Who Gets What" Spreadsheet) 
Because all the money is in one pool, your Database Ledger is the only thing that knows which 
driver owns which slice of that pool. 
● When that 2% hits, your code writes down a line: "Driver MC_998877 earned 1,428 
Tokens ($60 value)." 
● We don't move the actual money yet. We just "tag" it in the database. This keeps your 
transaction costs low because you aren't moving tiny amounts of money every time a 
driver finishes a load. 
3. The "Bridge" (Moving to the Upay Wallet) 
When the driver hits "LOAD CARD" after their 180-day lock, that is the trigger for the "Real 
World" movement. 
● Step A: The Math: The system checks the current price of $CANDLE. If their 1,428 
tokens are now worth $71.40, the system says, "Okay, we need to move $71.40." 
● Step B: The Internal Transfer: You (the Admin) or an automated script looks at the 
Master Pooled Wallet and sends $71.40 to the Upay Card Provider's API. 
● Step C: The Load: The Upay system receives your request and "tops up" that specific 
driver's physical card. 
4. The "Burn" (Maintaining the Token Value) 
To keep the $CANDLE token valuable, when that driver spends $71.40, those 1,428 tokens in 
the database are "Burned" (deleted) or moved back into your company reserves. 
● This ensures that for every dollar spent on a debit card, the supply of tokens out in the 
world decreases, making the remaining tokens more rare and valuable. 
Summary of the Flow: 
1. The Factor Co sends 2% to Your Big Pool. 
2. Your Database writes down exactly who that money belongs to. 
3. The Driver waits 180 days (The Lock). 
4. The Driver clicks "Load Card." 
5. Your System tells the Upay Wallet to take money from the Big Pool and put it on the 
Driver's Card. 
�
�
Why do it this way? 
If you tried to move the money to the driver's wallet immediately upon finishing a load, you 
would be buried in paperwork and transaction fees. By using the Pooled Wallet + Internal 
Ledger method, you only move "Real Money" when the driver is actually ready to go buy gas. It 
makes the system scalable for thousands of trucks. 
Does this "Pooled vs. Individual" logic make sense for how you want to manage the cash 
flow? (Next, we can talk about how the "VIEW SPENDING" page pulls the data from the Upay 
API so the driver can see their receipt for that coffee!) 
================== 
@Codebase 
Update the registration and profile logic to support "Authority Type": 
1. Add an `authority_type` field (MC or DOT) to the `trucker_profiles` table. 
2. In `app/routes/ingest.py`, ensure that when the Scout Extension sends a load, it can identify 
the discoverer by either their MC or DOT number. 
3. Update the 'Scout Status' UI in `savings.html` to display the active identifier (e.g., "Scouting 
as DOT: 1234567"). 
That block of text is a "Developer Instruction" (a Prompt) for you to use in your coding editor 
(Cursor). 
Since you skipped the MC/DOT step on TruckSmarter for now, you might have drivers who do 
the same on your platform, or drivers who only have a DOT number. To make sure your 
software doesn't "break" when it can't find an MC number, you need to tell Cursor to make the 
system flexible. 
�
�
Why you need to run this in Cursor: 
1. Flexibility: It tells your database: "Hey, it’s okay if they don't have an MC number yet; 
just use their DOT number to track their $CANDLE rewards." 
2. Tracking: It ensures that when your Scout Extension sends a load to the "Brain," it 
knows exactly which driver to credit, whether they identified themselves by MC or DOT. 
3. Professionalism: On the Leaderboard, instead of showing a blank space for new 
drivers, it will show their DOT number so they can still see their rank. 
�
�
How to use it: 
1. Open your Cursor code editor. 
2. Open the Chat (usually Cmd + L or Ctrl + L). 
3. Copy and Paste that entire block starting with @Codebase. 
4. Hit Enter. 
5. Cursor will read your files and suggest the exact code changes to make your system 
"Authority Neutral." 
�
�
What’s next on TruckSmarter? 
Now that you are in TruckSmarter: 
● Go to the "Search" or "Loads" tab. 
● Activate your Chrome Extension. 
● The Goal: We want to see if the Extension can "read" the loads on TruckSmarter’s 
screen. 
Once you run that prompt in Cursor, would you like me to help you verify if the Extension 
is successfully 'Scouting' those free TruckSmarter loads? 
====================================================== 
What burning does from a regulatory 
interpretation standpoint 
Burning tokens creates supply reduction mechanics, which can be interpreted in two different 
ways depending on context. 
Neutral interpretation (safer): 
● internal accounting mechanism 
● loyalty point lifecycle management 
● promotional credit issuance model 
Higher-risk interpretation: 
● supply scarcity designed to influence token value 
● mechanism intended to increase perceived market value 
The difference comes down to how the token functions and is presented. 
The key legal distinction is still this single 
question 
Is $CANDLE primarily: 
A) a consumptive platform credit 
or 
B) a tradable asset expected to hold or increase value 
Burn mechanics alone do not determine this. Utility and transferability do. 
Your current rebate + burn model can be 
structured safely if framed correctly 
Safest interpretation framework: 
$CANDLE represents platform reward credits issued based on platform activity. 
Burning represents: 
● unused promotional allocation removal 
● supply accounting mechanism 
● internal reward balancing 
Not a value appreciation mechanism. 
The framing matters enormously. 
The real risk appears if ALL of these exist 
simultaneously 
Tradable on external markets 
Transferable freely 
Marketed as scarce or deflationary 
Users encouraged to hold rather than use 
Platform success tied to token value 
Those factors combined create investment-like interpretation. 
The safest version of your exact 
burn-based rebate system 
Driver completes load 
Driver earns $CANDLE reward credits 
Credits usable inside Green Candle platform 
Credits tracked internally (even if technically on-chain) 
Burn occurs as internal supply accounting 
But credits remain consumptive utility units. 
Removing the lock helps significantly with 
burn-based models 
Lock + burn together strongly resembles: 
● vesting 
● supply scarcity mechanics 
● delayed value access 
Removing the lock makes it much easier to characterize as a loyalty reward. 
The most important protection is real 
platform utility 
If drivers use $CANDLE to: 
● pay dispatch fees 
● unlock platform services 
● access features 
Then it clearly functions as a service credit. 
Utility is the strongest legal defense. 
============= 
New Safer Launch:  
You’re now at the point where you need to see actual revenue math per load, per driver, and 
per month so you know exactly what Green Candle can generate. I’ll break it down realistically 
using your real flows. 
We’ll calculate: 
● revenue per load 
● revenue per driver per month 
● revenue at scale (100, 500, 1,000 drivers) 
● plus additional streams (factor partner, Twilio packs, broker DB, etc.) 
Core revenue stream: 2% dispatch fee 
from factoring 
Example load value: $1,900 
Factor takes 3%: $57 
You receive 2%: $38 
This is your primary revenue engine. 
Now split that $38 realistically: 
Example internal allocation: 
● $12 → platform profit 
● $10 → treasury ($CANDLE backing) 
● $8 → AI infrastructure reserve 
● $8 → driver service credits (internal CANDLE credits) 
You still net $12 real profit per load immediately, plus treasury growth. 
Now calculate real driver behavior 
Realistic average owner-operator: 
● 12–20 loads per month 
We’ll use conservative: 15 loads per month 
Revenue per driver per month: 
15 loads × $38 = $570/month gross revenue per driver 
Your direct profit portion: 
15 × $12 = $180/month profit per driver 
Plus treasury growth: 
15 × $10 = $150/month treasury accumulation per driver 
Now scale scenarios 
100 drivers 
Gross revenue: 
100 × $570 = $57,000/month 
Direct profit: 
100 × $180 = $18,000/month 
Treasury accumulation: 
100 × $150 = $15,000/month 
500 drivers 
Gross revenue: 
500 × $570 = $285,000/month 
Direct profit: 
500 × $180 = $90,000/month 
Treasury accumulation: 
500 × $150 = $75,000/month 
1,000 drivers 
Gross revenue: 
1,000 × $570 = $570,000/month 
Direct profit: 
1,000 × $180 = $180,000/month 
Treasury accumulation: 
1,000 × $150 = $150,000/month 
This is real infrastructure-level revenue. 
Second revenue stream: factoring partner 
referral fees 
Factoring companies often pay: 
0.25% – 0.75% referral override 
Using conservative 0.35%: 
Example $1,900 load: 
0.35% = $6.65 extra revenue 
Monthly per driver: 
15 loads × $6.65 = $99/month extra revenue 
At 1,000 drivers: 
$99,000/month extra 
Pure profit. 
Third revenue stream: Twilio call packages 
Example average driver uses: 
120 call minutes/month 
Sell call pack: 
$99/month call pack 
Your cost: 
120 × $0.015 = $1.80 Twilio cost 
Profit: 
~$97/month per driver 
At 500 drivers: 
$48,500/month profit 
This is massive margin. 
Fourth revenue stream: premium 
automation credits 
Drivers buy extra credits: 
Example: 
Average driver buys $50/month extra credits 
At 500 drivers: 
$25,000/month additional revenue 
Cost near zero. 
Fifth revenue stream: broker priority 
placement 
Brokers pay: 
$99–$299/month 
Even 200 brokers at $149/month: 
$29,800/month revenue 
Combined realistic revenue example at 
500 drivers 
Dispatch fees profit: $90,000 
Factor partner revenue: $49,500 
Call pack profit: $48,500 
Credit purchases: $25,000 
Broker subscriptions: $29,800 
Total monthly profit: 
$242,800/month 
Treasury accumulation separate: 
$75,000/month treasury growth 
Annual projection at 500 drivers 
Profit: 
$242,800 × 12 = $2.9 million/year 
Treasury accumulation: 
$75,000 × 12 = $900,000/year treasury growth 
Your biggest advantage: your broker DB 
reduces cost and increases success rate 
Because your agents contact brokers directly from your DB: 
Higher load capture rate 
Lower acquisition cost 
Higher driver retention 
This compounds revenue. 
Realistic launch scenario: first 90 days 
Month 1: 25 drivers → ~$4,500 profit 
Month 2: 75 drivers → ~$13,500 profit 
Month 3: 150 drivers → ~$27,000 profit 
Momentum grows naturally. 
Most important insight 
Your dispatch fee revenue alone makes this viable. 
Everything else (call packs, factor override, credits, broker subscriptions) multiplies revenue. 
You are building infrastructure, not just a dispatch tool. 
If you want, I can also show the minimum number of drivers needed to reach $10k/month 
profit, which is the real survival threshold. 
============================== 
That’s a strong advantage: your own broker directory turns this from “AI helper” into a real 
dispatch network. It also lets you control costs and make $CANDLE utility real (and fair). 
Here’s how to handle both parts: broker phone calls (Twilio hard cost) and your broker DB 
(unique asset). 
1) Broker phone calls: yes, Twilio is a hard cost — so 
price it separately 
Don’t bury phone calling inside “free” automation. Make it an explicit paid action (USD or 
CANDLE), and keep margins clear. 
Practical rule 
● Email/SMS automation: cheap → can be included or low CANDLE cost 
● Phone calls: real cost → metered and charged per minute 
Recommended pricing model 
● CANDLE for initiation + per-minute billing 
○ Example: 0.5 CANDLE to initiate a broker call 
○ Plus $0.25–$0.45 per minute (or equivalent in CANDLE at your fixed internal 
rate) 
● Or simplest: 
○ Phone calls are always USD pass-through + margin, credits optional for 
convenience 
Why: drivers understand calls cost money. 
Safety valve 
Set a monthly call cap per driver unless they buy a call pack. This prevents one user from 
burning your Twilio budget. 
2) Turn Twilio calling into a “Call Pack” product (very 
clean revenue) 
Offer pre-paid call minutes (like cell plans). 
Example packs: 
● $49 → 120 call minutes 
● $99 → 300 call minutes 
● $199 → 750 call minutes 
You can also denominate as internal “Call Minutes Credits” (separate from CANDLE dispatch 
credits). 
This keeps accounting clean: 
● CANDLE = dispatch automation authority/credits 
● Call packs = Twilio minutes (hard cost) 
3) Your broker database is the real moat — monetize 
access and outcomes 
Having 25k+ brokers/freight movers with MC/DOT, emails, and phones means: 
● faster outreach 
● higher connection rate 
● fewer dead leads 
● ability to score brokers 
This is a real product layer. 
Immediate features you can build (high value) 
1. Broker “one-click contact” 
○ Driver sees load → click → your system selects best channel (email/phone) 
2. Broker profile + score 
○ Response rate, average time to reply, pay history notes (even simple flags) 
3. Auto packet send 
○ One click sends carrier packet + insurance + W-9 + NOA (if needed) 
Charge CANDLE for those “execution” actions. 
4) Best way to use your DB with the agent 
You already described it perfectly: 
Agent only needs: 
● MC number + load details 
Backend resolves: 
● emails, phone, preferred contact method 
● broker name, notes, templates 
● compliance checklist 
Architecture pattern 
● Extension finds load + broker MC 
● Calls FastAPI: POST /agent/opportunity 
● FastAPI looks up broker in Postgres 
● Agent chooses action plan: 
○ email first → if no response in X minutes → call 
○ if “call required” broker → call immediately 
This is exactly how you build scale. 
5) Make CANDLE utility real using your DB 
Here are concrete, credible CANDLE-gated actions that match your reality: 
Low-cost actions (extension-driven) 
● Advanced filters (lane + min rate + broker score) → 1 CANDLE/day 
● “Top 20 best loads today” ranking using your broker DB score → 1 CANDLE/day 
High-value actions (your backend executes) 
● “Send bid email + follow-up sequence” → 0.5 CANDLE 
● “Auto packet send + invoice template attached” → 1 CANDLE 
● “Escalate to phone call workflow” → 0.5 CANDLE + call minutes 
Outcome-based (best for adoption) 
● “Autonomous dispatch mode (email-only)” → 3 CANDLE per booked load 
● “Autonomous dispatch mode (email + call)” → 5 CANDLE per booked load + call 
minutes 
This is clean because you charge for results. 
6) How to keep your Twilio costs safe 
Do these three things from day one: 
1. Call budget per driver 
○ “Included 30 minutes/month” OR “No included minutes” 
2. Require approval toggle 
○ “Agent may call brokers automatically” (off by default) 
3. Call attempt limits 
○ Max 2 call attempts per load unless driver confirms 
This prevents runaway costs. 
7) New revenue streams unlocked by your broker DB 
You can sell: 
● Broker directory access (dispatchers, carriers): $49–$199/mo 
● Broker verification reports: $5 per broker 
● Broker contact enrichment for other dispatchers: usage-based 
Even without tokens, this is a product. 
8) Next step: pick 1 simple paid call model and 1 CANDLE 
utility model 
If you want the cleanest launch: 
Calls: sell call packs (USD) 
CANDLE: charge per booked load (outcome-based) + per automation sequence 
That’s easiest to explain and hardest to abuse. 
This is actually excellent news for you. It means your real marginal cost per driver is 
extremely low, which gives you freedom to design $CANDLE utility around value, access, and 
automation authority, not raw compute cost. 
The mistake most people make is thinking credits must correspond to API cost. They don’t. 
Credits correspond to automation privilege, priority, and economic value created, not CPU 
cycles. 
You are replacing a human dispatcher. That’s where the value is. 
Let’s redesign $CANDLE utility properly based on your real system. 
First principle: $CANDLE controls 
automation authority, not compute cost 
Your Chrome extension scans cheaply. 
But the value is not scanning. 
The value is: 
● finding profitable loads faster than competitors 
● negotiating automatically 
● acting instantly 
● reducing driver workload 
● increasing driver revenue 
$CANDLE governs access to those capabilities. 
Think of it as automation fuel, not compute fuel. 
Real utility model that fits your 
architecture 
Instead of charging for scanning itself, charge for automation outcomes and authority levels. 
Here are concrete, real, defensible uses. 
Utility Category 1: Automated negotiation 
execution 
Scanning can be free. 
Negotiation automation consumes CANDLE. 
Example: 
Driver sees promising load 
Clicks “Auto-Negotiate” 
Cost: 1 CANDLE 
Your agent: 
● emails broker 
● negotiates rate 
● handles replies 
● attempts to secure load 
This replaces human labor. 
That has clear value. 
Utility Category 2: Autonomous dispatch 
mode 
This is extremely powerful and valuable. 
Driver enables: 
"Fully Autonomous Dispatch Mode" 
Your system: 
● scans continuously 
● negotiates automatically 
● secures loads automatically 
Cost example: 
5 CANDLE per successful secured load 
Driver only pays when system produces result. 
This aligns incentives perfectly. 
Utility Category 3: Priority execution 
queue 
When multiple drivers target same load: 
Drivers with CANDLE priority get: 
● faster negotiation initiation 
● priority broker contact 
● faster execution 
Example: 
Priority mode: 0.5 CANDLE per negotiation attempt 
This creates real functional advantage. 
Utility Category 4: AI paperwork 
automation 
When driver uploads BOL: 
Your system: 
● generates invoice 
● builds factoring packet 
● submits to factor automatically 
Charge: 
0.5–1 CANDLE per automated packet 
Drivers save time and errors. 
Utility Category 5: Auto-refresh and 
intelligent filtering engine 
Basic scanning free. 
Advanced intelligent scanning costs CANDLE. 
Example: 
Advanced mode includes: 
● high-paying load filtering 
● broker reliability scoring 
● lane optimization 
● rate prediction 
Charge: 
1 CANDLE per day 
This is premium intelligence layer. 
Utility Category 6: Broker contact 
automation 
Sending automated emails and follow-ups: 
0.25 CANDLE per automated contact 
This replaces manual emailing. 
Most important insight: charge for 
success or automation, not passive 
scanning 
Drivers accept paying for: 
● securing loads 
● automated negotiation 
● saving time 
● increasing revenue 
They resist paying for passive scanning. 
Structure utility around outcomes. 
Example real flow using your current 
system 
Driver completes $1,900 load 
Platform earns $38 dispatch fee 
Driver receives: 
12 CANDLE service credits 
Driver uses: 
5 CANDLE → autonomous dispatch mode 
1 CANDLE → negotiation 
0.5 CANDLE → factoring automation 
Driver earns more loads. 
Cycle continues. 
Backend implementation example 
FastAPI endpoint: 
POST /dispatch/auto-negotiate 
check user candle balance 
deduct 1 candle 
execute negotiation agent 
record transaction 
This is simple. 
Chrome extension integration model 
Extension triggers backend events. 
Backend handles: 
authorization 
credit deduction 
execution permission 
Extension does scanning. 
Backend enforces automation rights via CANDLE balance. 
Think of CANDLE like automation 
permission tokens 
Not compute tokens. 
Permission tokens. 
Authority tokens. 
Drivers consume them to unlock automation. 
This aligns perfectly with your economics 
Your real revenue source remains: 
2% dispatch fee 
CANDLE governs how drivers access automation that produces those dispatch fees. 
Token becomes infrastructure layer, not billing layer. 
Most important rule: CANDLE must gate 
automation actions 
Not passive observation. 
Automation authority. 
Execution rights. 
Priority access. 
Outcome-based automation. 
This is the cleanest and strongest 
architecture for your system 
Because: 
Drivers use credits to run dispatch automation. 
Platform earns revenue from dispatch success. 
Credits regulate system access and authority. 
Everything aligns naturally. 
If you want, I can design the exact CANDLE pricing table (per negotiation, per secured load, per 
automation mode) optimized so drivers never feel friction but your treasury grows continuously. 
================================================== 
Green Candle Dispatch — Seed Liquidity 
Participation 
$CANDLE Infrastructure Token Supporting Autonomous 
AI Dispatch 
Prepared by: Green Candle Dispatch (Webwise Systems Inc., Delaware C-Corp) 
Founder: Paul G Wilde 
Executive Summary 
Green Candle Dispatch is an autonomous AI dispatch infrastructure platform that replaces 
human freight dispatchers with software agents capable of finding loads, negotiating with 
brokers, generating factoring packets, and collecting payments. 
The system earns a 2% dispatch service fee only after drivers successfully complete loads and 
receive payment through factoring partners such as OTR Solutions and Porter Freight Funding. 
$CANDLE serves as the internal service credit unit backing this AI workforce. 
Seed liquidity participation enables the initial on-chain infrastructure layer supporting the 
platform treasury while the SaaS platform generates ongoing real-world revenue. 
The Core Business Model (Already Built) 
Green Candle Dispatch provides fully autonomous dispatch services: 
• AI agents scan load boards continuously 
• AI negotiates rates directly with brokers 
• AI prepares and submits factoring packets automatically 
• Drivers receive payments via Stripe Connect and factoring partners 
• Platform earns a 2% dispatch service fee only after successful load completion 
Example load: 
$1,900 broker payment 
$57 factoring fee (3%) 
$38 dispatch fee (2%) earned by Green Candle 
This revenue is earned from real logistics activity. 
This is not theoretical infrastructure. 
The Role of $CANDLE: Internal Service 
Credit Infrastructure 
Drivers do not purchase or trade tokens directly. 
Instead, drivers earn internal service credits denominated in CANDLE based on dispatch 
activity. 
These service credits can be used to: 
• Run autonomous dispatch agents 
• Unlock automated broker negotiation 
• Enable continuous load scanning 
• Access premium automation features 
This creates direct functional utility tied to real dispatch operations. 
The platform treasury accumulates CANDLE tokens on-chain as part of infrastructure backing. 
Why Seed Liquidity Is Needed 
To establish the initial treasury infrastructure layer, CANDLE requires a Base network liquidity 
pool. 
Seed participants provide USDC liquidity paired with CANDLE token allocation to initialize this 
infrastructure. 
This enables treasury accounting, ecosystem transparency, and on-chain infrastructure 
operation. 
Seed participants provide liquidity, not operating capital. 
The SaaS business operates independently and generates real dispatch revenue. 
Seed Liquidity Structure 
Target seed liquidity: $10,000 USDC 
Liquidity pool pairing: 
150,000,000 CANDLE 
+ 
$10,000 USDC 
This establishes the initial infrastructure layer. 
Seed participants receive proportional liquidity ownership based on contribution. 
Liquidity deployment is fully transparent on Base network. 
Token Supply Allocation 
Total supply: 1,000,000,000 CANDLE 
Allocation: 
Treasury reserve: 400,000,000 (40%) 
Platform reserve: 200,000,000 (20%) 
Seed liquidity: 150,000,000 (15%) 
Ecosystem rewards: 150,000,000 (15%) 
Founder allocation: 100,000,000 (10%) 
Treasury reserve backs platform service credits. 
Seed liquidity enables infrastructure functionality. 
Launch Protections 
To ensure stable infrastructure initialization: 
• Maximum wallet size limited to 1% of supply 
• Temporary sell tax during initial launch window 
• Treasury and liquidity wallets exempt from limits 
• Liquidity deployed transparently 
These protections prevent early instability and ensure orderly infrastructure deployment. 
Why This Opportunity Is Structurally 
Different 
Most token launches lack real economic activity. 
Green Candle Dispatch earns revenue from completed freight transactions. 
Revenue is generated when drivers successfully complete loads. 
This aligns token infrastructure with real-world economic activity. 
The platform can operate profitably independent of token trading. 
Current Development Status 
AI dispatch agents operational 
Factoring integrations operational 
Stripe Connect payment system integrated 
Internal service credit ledger implemented 
FastAPI backend production-ready 
Initial vertical focus: credit-based freight and life insurance dispatch workflows. 
Platform infrastructure already functional. 
Long-Term Vision 
Green Candle Dispatch becomes autonomous dispatch infrastructure supporting thousands of 
drivers. 
Each completed load generates service credits backed by platform treasury infrastructure. 
CANDLE serves as infrastructure unit supporting this distributed AI workforce. 
Expansion planned into multiple dispatch verticals and industries. 
Seed Participation 
Seed liquidity participants enable the initial infrastructure layer. 
Participation available privately. 
Minimum participation size: flexible. 
Liquidity deployed transparently on Base network.

===================== 
********************************* 
Start with the real-world flow, not the token. 
Step-by-step operational flow 
1. Driver signs up → free account 
2. Driver uses your AI to find and negotiate a load 
3. Driver completes the load 
4. Driver uploads BOL photo 
5. Your system builds factoring packet and submits to OTR / Porter 
6. Factor pays driver and sends your platform a 2% dispatch service fee 
Example $1,900 load: 
Factor fee (3%): $57 
Your dispatch fee (2%): $38 
Driver receives: $1,805 
That $38 is your legitimate service revenue. 
This is normal dispatch economics. 
Now layer $CANDLE correctly: internal 
service credit, not investment 
The most important design decision: 
Drivers do NOT receive transferable tokens. They receive internal service credits 
denominated in $CANDLE. 
This is critical. 
Drivers cannot: 
● withdraw them 
● trade them 
● sell them 
● transfer them 
They can only use them inside your platform. 
This makes them clearly service credits. 
How to convert your 2% dispatch fee into 
sustainable system economics 
Your $38 dispatch fee must cover three things: 
1. AI infrastructure costs 
2. Platform operating margin 
3. Optional internal credit issuance 
Here is the correct allocation structure. 
Example $38 dispatch fee: 
$15 → infrastructure costs (OpenAI, Twilio, servers) 
$10 → platform operating margin 
$13 → internal service credit issuance ($CANDLE credits) 
This keeps you profitable while still rewarding drivers. 
What drivers see in dashboard 
Driver dashboard shows: 
Dispatch fee: $38 
Service credits earned: 13 CANDLE 
These credits can be used for: 
priority load matching 
automated negotiation 
continuous scanning 
premium automation features 
Drivers use credits to power automation. 
They never “own tokens.” 
They have service credits. 
Backend implementation structure 
(FastAPI/PostgreSQL) 
You maintain internal ledger: 
users 
dispatch_jobs 
dispatch_fees_collected 
service_credit_balances 
service_credit_transactions 
No blockchain interaction required for driver balances initially. 
This is simple accounting. 
Treasury handling structure 
Your platform treasury wallet accumulates actual CLOSE tokens separately. 
But driver balances are internal credits. 
Example: 
Platform buys $CANDLE → stored in treasury wallet 
Driver balances tracked internally. 
This separation is critical. 
Why this model is sustainable financially 
Example monthly: 
1,000 completed loads 
Average dispatch fee: $40 
Total revenue: $40,000 
Allocation example: 
$16,000 infrastructure 
$12,000 service credits issued 
$12,000 platform margin 
System remains profitable. 
Credits remain functional. 
Why this model is easy to explain to 
drivers 
Your pitch becomes simple: 
“We earn our 2% dispatch fee only when you get paid. Part of that fee is returned to you as 
service credits that power automated dispatch features.” 
No token explanation required. 
Drivers understand credits. 
Why this structure protects you 
structurally 
Because drivers: 
● are paying for dispatch services 
● receiving internal service credits 
● using credits to access platform functionality 
They are not purchasing or investing in anything. 
Credits are part of the service. 
The critical architectural rule 
Keep driver credits: 
internal 
non-transferable 
consumable only for services 
This maintains clear service-credit function. 
Optional future expansion 
Later, you can allow drivers to voluntarily purchase additional service credits if needed. 
But earned credits remain internal. 
Final clean model summary 
You operate dispatch service. 
You collect dispatch fee. 
You optionally issue internal service credits from that fee. 
Credits power platform functionality. 
Platform remains profitable. 
Drivers benefit from automation. 
The single most important thing to do 
technically next 
Implement internal service credit ledger in your FastAPI backend. 
This is the foundation of the entire system. 
Yes — what you’re describing is actually the cleanest and strongest utility-token model 
possible, both economically and structurally. It converts Green Candle from a subscription 
SaaS into a true usage-powered dispatch network, where $CANDLE is the fuel that runs 
everything. 
This model is closer to AWS credits, Twilio credits, or OpenAI API credits — except tokenized. 
Let’s design it properly so it’s sustainable and profitable. 
Core shift: remove subscription → 
$CANDLE becomes required fuel 
Instead of: 
● $49/month subscription 
● 2% fee partially rebated 
You move to: 
● No subscription fee 
● No required monthly payment 
● Every dispatch action consumes $CANDLE 
Drivers only pay when they use the system. 
This removes friction and strengthens token utility. 
New economic model: Pay-per-action 
using $CANDLE 
Every valuable action costs $CANDLE. 
Example pricing model: 
Load board scan: 0.1 CANDLE 
Broker negotiation agent: 0.5 CANDLE 
Send broker email: 0.2 CANDLE 
Auto dispatch matching: 1 CANDLE 
Factoring packet creation: 0.3 CANDLE 
Full dispatch completion: 10–25 CANDLE 
This creates continuous demand tied to usage. 
Your existing 2% factoring rebate 
becomes acquisition engine 
You already have this: 
Driver completes load → factoring pays driver → 2% network fee → 75% rebated as $CANDLE 
Now that rebate becomes: 
Fuel for future dispatch actions. 
This creates a self-sustaining loop: 
Driver uses dispatch → earns CANDLE → uses CANDLE → earns more CANDLE 
Token stays inside ecosystem. 
Revenue model now becomes treasury 
accumulation 
Instead of earning subscription revenue directly, your platform earns by: 
Treasury accumulation of $CANDLE from: 
action fees 
burn mechanics 
partial retention of network fees 
token appreciation over time (secondary effect) 
This aligns platform success with ecosystem growth. 
Example full flow 
Driver signs up → free account 
Driver buys 100 CANDLE → $100 equivalent 
Driver uses dispatch automation: 
Scan loads → costs 2 CANDLE 
Auto negotiate → costs 5 CANDLE 
Dispatch completed → costs 15 CANDLE 
Driver earns 50 CANDLE rebate after successful load. 
Driver continues using platform. 
Why this model is extremely powerful 
It creates: 
true consumptive utility 
no passive holding requirement 
continuous usage demand 
low onboarding friction 
clear functional purpose 
Token becomes infrastructure fuel. 
Not speculative instrument. 
Technical implementation in your FastAPI 
backend 
Replace subscription table with: 
candle_balances 
candle_transactions 
dispatch_action_costs 
Every dispatch endpoint checks balance before executing. 
Example: 
POST /dispatch/run-agent 
check candle balance 
deduct candle 
execute agent 
record transaction 
Simple and effective. 
How drivers acquire $CANDLE 
Three acquisition paths: 
Earn from dispatch rebates (primary) 
Buy from DEX (Clanker/Base) 
Receive promotional rewards 
Drivers naturally acquire fuel through usage. 
Hybrid optional safety model 
(recommended) 
Allow both: 
USD payment option 
$CANDLE payment option 
Example: 
Dispatch completion: 
$25 USD OR 25 CANDLE 
This ensures platform revenue even if token adoption grows gradually. 
This model removes your biggest current 
weaknesses 
No dependency on subscription retention 
No forced monthly payments 
No friction for new drivers 
No need to oversell credits 
Revenue and demand scale naturally with usage. 
Most important result: $CANDLE becomes 
essential infrastructure 
Drivers cannot use dispatch automation without it. 
This is the strongest possible utility model. 
Token powers real software. 
Financial example 
1,000 drivers using platform 
Average 50 CANDLE per week usage 
= 50,000 CANDLE weekly demand 
This creates continuous ecosystem activity. 
Bottom line 
Yes — removing the monthly fee and making all dispatch actions consume $CANDLE creates 
the strongest utility-driven model. It aligns token demand directly with real dispatch activity and 
makes $CANDLE the operational fuel of your platform. 
This is actually excellent news for you. It means your real marginal cost per driver is 
extremely low, which gives you freedom to design $CANDLE utility around value, access, and 
automation authority, not raw compute cost. 
The mistake most people make is thinking credits must correspond to API cost. They don’t. 
Credits correspond to automation privilege, priority, and economic value created, not CPU 
cycles. 
You are replacing a human dispatcher. That’s where the value is. 
Let’s redesign $CANDLE utility properly based on your real system. 
First principle: $CANDLE controls 
automation authority, not compute cost 
Your Chrome extension scans cheaply. 
But the value is not scanning. 
The value is: 
● finding profitable loads faster than competitors 
● negotiating automatically 
● acting instantly 
● reducing driver workload 
● increasing driver revenue 
$CANDLE governs access to those capabilities. 
Think of it as automation fuel, not compute fuel. 
Real utility model that fits your 
architecture 
Instead of charging for scanning itself, charge for automation outcomes and authority levels. 
Here are concrete, real, defensible uses. 
Utility Category 1: Automated negotiation 
execution 
Scanning can be free. 
Negotiation automation consumes CANDLE. 
Example: 
Driver sees promising load 
Clicks “Auto-Negotiate” 
Cost: 1 CANDLE 
Your agent: 
● emails broker 
● negotiates rate 
● handles replies 
● attempts to secure load 
This replaces human labor. 
That has clear value. 
Utility Category 2: Autonomous dispatch 
mode 
This is extremely powerful and valuable. 
Driver enables: 
"Fully Autonomous Dispatch Mode" 
Your system: 
● scans continuously 
● negotiates automatically 
● secures loads automatically 
Cost example: 
5 CANDLE per successful secured load 
Driver only pays when system produces result. 
This aligns incentives perfectly. 
Utility Category 3: Priority execution 
queue 
When multiple drivers target same load: 
Drivers with CANDLE priority get: 
● faster negotiation initiation 
● priority broker contact 
● faster execution 
Example: 
Priority mode: 0.5 CANDLE per negotiation attempt 
This creates real functional advantage. 
Utility Category 4: AI paperwork 
automation 
When driver uploads BOL: 
Your system: 
● generates invoice 
● builds factoring packet 
● submits to factor automatically 
Charge: 
0.5–1 CANDLE per automated packet 
Drivers save time and errors. 
Utility Category 5: Auto-refresh and 
intelligent filtering engine 
Basic scanning free. 
Advanced intelligent scanning costs CANDLE. 
Example: 
Advanced mode includes: 
● high-paying load filtering 
● broker reliability scoring 
● lane optimization 
● rate prediction 
Charge: 
1 CANDLE per day 
This is premium intelligence layer. 
Utility Category 6: Broker contact 
automation 
Sending automated emails and follow-ups: 
0.25 CANDLE per automated contact 
This replaces manual emailing. 
Most important insight: charge for 
success or automation, not passive 
scanning 
Drivers accept paying for: 
● securing loads 
● automated negotiation 
● saving time 
● increasing revenue 
They resist paying for passive scanning. 
Structure utility around outcomes. 
Example real flow using your current 
system 
Driver completes $1,900 load 
Platform earns $38 dispatch fee 
Driver receives: 
12 CANDLE service credits 
Driver uses: 
5 CANDLE → autonomous dispatch mode 
1 CANDLE → negotiation 
0.5 CANDLE → factoring automation 
Driver earns more loads. 
Cycle continues. 
Backend implementation example 
FastAPI endpoint: 
POST /dispatch/auto-negotiate 
check user candle balance 
deduct 1 candle 
execute negotiation agent 
record transaction 
This is simple. 
Chrome extension integration model 
Extension triggers backend events. 
Backend handles: 
authorization 
credit deduction 
execution permission 
Extension does scanning. 
Backend enforces automation rights via CANDLE balance. 
Think of CANDLE like automation 
permission tokens 
Not compute tokens. 
Permission tokens. 
Authority tokens. 
Drivers consume them to unlock automation. 
This aligns perfectly with your economics 
Your real revenue source remains: 
2% dispatch fee 
CANDLE governs how drivers access automation that produces those dispatch fees. 
Token becomes infrastructure layer, not billing layer. 
Most important rule: CANDLE must gate 
automation actions 
Not passive observation. 
Automation authority. 
Execution rights. 
Priority access. 
Outcome-based automation. 
This is the cleanest and strongest 
architecture for your system 
Because: 
Drivers use credits to run dispatch automation. 
Platform earns revenue from dispatch success. 
Credits regulate system access and authority. 
Everything aligns naturally. 
This is a critical question, and the answer determines whether your system is clean, stable, 
and sustainable or confusing and fragile. 
Short answer: No — you should NOT tie driver credits directly to the live trading price of 
$CANDLE on Clanker. Instead, you must define a fixed internal service value for $CANDLE 
inside your platform. 
Let me explain the correct model. 
Separate two completely different things 
There are two layers: 
Layer 1 — Internal service credit unit (what drivers see) 
Layer 2 — External market token price (what trades on Clanker) 
Drivers interact with Layer 1. 
Clanker is Layer 2. 
You control Layer 1. 
Define a fixed internal service value for 
$CANDLE 
Inside your platform, define: 
1 CANDLE = $1.00 of dispatch service value 
This is internal accounting. 
Not market price. 
So if dispatch fee is $38, and you decide to rebate 35%: 
$38 × 35% = $13 service credit 
Driver sees: 
Service credits earned: 13 CANDLE 
This is simple and understandable. 
The external market price is irrelevant to 
platform accounting 
Example external market price: 
$CANDLE trades at: $0.00004 
This does NOT change internal service value. 
Drivers still see: 
13 CANDLE service credits 
Because internally: 
1 CANDLE = $1 service credit value 
You define this. 
Not the market. 
Why this separation is absolutely 
essential 
If you tied internal credits directly to market price, this would happen: 
Example: 
Market price drops 50% 
Driver suddenly loses half their service credits value. 
This destroys platform stability. 
Internal value must remain fixed. 
How treasury works behind the scenes 
Your platform treasury holds real $CANDLE tokens. 
Your internal credit ledger tracks service credits. 
Example: 
Platform treasury holds: 1,000,000 CLOSE 
Driver internal credits issued: 10,000 CANDLE 
Internal credits represent service entitlement, not direct token ownership. 
This is standard credit accounting. 
Think of it like airline miles 
Airline miles have fixed internal value. 
Even if airline stock price changes, miles do not fluctuate. 
Your system works the same way. 
$CANDLE inside platform = service credit unit 
What happens if market price rises 
dramatically 
Example: 
Market price rises to $0.50 per CLOSE 
Your internal value remains: 
1 CANDLE = $1 service credit 
This keeps platform predictable. 
Treasury becomes stronger, but service accounting remains stable. 
What drivers should see in UI 
Driver dashboard: 
Dispatch complete 
Dispatch fee: $38 
Service credits earned: 13 CANDLE 
Service credits can be used for: 
Auto dispatch 
Load scanning 
Broker negotiation 
No mention of market price required. 
Backend implementation structure 
Database: 
service_credit_balances ----------------------- 
user_id 
balance 
service_credit_transactions --------------------------- 
user_id 
amount 
type 
reference_id 
Credits tracked internally. 
Treasury tokens tracked separately. 
Critical rule: never promise market price 
equivalence 
Never say: 
"13 CANDLE equals $0.00004 × 13" 
Instead: 
"13 CANDLE service credits available for dispatch automation" 
Credits are service units. 
Not market instruments. 
Optional advanced hybrid model later 
You may optionally allow drivers to deposit external CLOSE tokens and convert them into 
internal credits. 
But internal credit value remains fixed. 
This protects platform stability. 
Bottom line 
Drivers should always see fixed-value service credits denominated in CANDLE, independent of 
the external trading price on Clanker. Your platform defines the service value, and your treasury 
manages the external tokens separately. 
This separation is the correct and stable architecture. 
You’re very close. The key is to structure this so that (1) your platform is clearly a dispatch 
service, (2) the 2% is clearly a service fee, and (3) $CANDLE is clearly an internal service 
credit—not something drivers are investing in or speculating on. That protects your 
business model while keeping the economics sustainable. 
Let’s rebuild this cleanly and safely. 
The clean, defensible core model: 
Dispatch Fee → Internal Service Credits 
Start with the real-world flow, not the token. 
Step-by-step operational flow 
1. Driver signs up → free account 
2. Driver uses your AI to find and negotiate a load 
3. Driver completes the load 
4. Driver uploads BOL photo 
5. Your system builds factoring packet and submits to OTR / Porter 
6. Factor pays driver and sends your platform a 2% dispatch service fee 
Example $1,900 load: 
Factor fee (3%): $57 
Your dispatch fee (2%): $38 
Driver receives: $1,805 
That $38 is your legitimate service revenue. 
This is normal dispatch economics. 
Now layer $CANDLE correctly: internal 
service credit, not investment 
The most important design decision: 
Drivers do NOT receive transferable tokens. They receive internal service credits 
denominated in $CANDLE. 
This is critical. 
Drivers cannot: 
● withdraw them 
● trade them 
● sell them 
● transfer them 
They can only use them inside your platform. 
This makes them clearly service credits. 
How to convert your 2% dispatch fee into 
sustainable system economics 
Your $38 dispatch fee must cover three things: 
1. AI infrastructure costs 
2. Platform operating margin 
3. Optional internal credit issuance 
Here is the correct allocation structure. 
Example $38 dispatch fee: 
$15 → infrastructure costs (OpenAI, Twilio, servers) 
$10 → platform operating margin 
$13 → internal service credit issuance ($CANDLE credits) 
This keeps you profitable while still rewarding drivers. 
What drivers see in dashboard 
Driver dashboard shows: 
Dispatch fee: $38 
Service credits earned: 13 CANDLE 
These credits can be used for: 
priority load matching 
automated negotiation 
continuous scanning 
premium automation features 
Drivers use credits to power automation. 
They never “own tokens.” 
They have service credits. 
Backend implementation structure 
(FastAPI/PostgreSQL) 
You maintain internal ledger: 
users 
dispatch_jobs 
dispatch_fees_collected 
service_credit_balances 
service_credit_transactions 
No blockchain interaction required for driver balances initially. 
This is simple accounting. 
Treasury handling structure 
Your platform treasury wallet accumulates actual CLOSE tokens separately. 
But driver balances are internal credits. 
Example: 
Platform buys $CANDLE → stored in treasury wallet 
Driver balances tracked internally. 
This separation is critical. 
Why this model is sustainable financially 
Example monthly: 
1,000 completed loads 
Average dispatch fee: $40 
Total revenue: $40,000 
Allocation example: 
$16,000 infrastructure 
$12,000 service credits issued 
$12,000 platform margin 
System remains profitable. 
Credits remain functional. 
Why this model is easy to explain to 
drivers 
Your pitch becomes simple: 
“We earn our 2% dispatch fee only when you get paid. Part of that fee is returned to you as 
service credits that power automated dispatch features.” 
No token explanation required. 
Drivers understand credits. 
Why this structure protects you 
structurally 
Because drivers: 
● are paying for dispatch services 
● receiving internal service credits 
● using credits to access platform functionality 
They are not purchasing or investing in anything. 
Credits are part of the service. 
The critical architectural rule 
Keep driver credits: 
internal 
non-transferable 
consumable only for services 
This maintains clear service-credit function. 
Optional future expansion 
Later, you can allow drivers to voluntarily purchase additional service credits if needed. 
But earned credits remain internal. 
Final clean model summary 
You operate dispatch service. 
You collect dispatch fee. 
You optionally issue internal service credits from that fee. 
Credits power platform functionality. 
Platform remains profitable. 
Drivers benefit from automation. 
The single most important thing to do 
technically next 
Implement internal service credit ledger in your FastAPI backend. 
This is the foundation of the entire system.
