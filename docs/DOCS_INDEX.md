# Docs index

**Current system (what we actually have):** **[updated-plan.md](./updated-plan.md)**

Use that file as the single source of truth. When notes get mixed up with legacy, treat everything else in `docs/` as reference only; `updated-plan.md` wins.

**New README / plan notes:** Add them to `updated-plan.md` (or link from it). For deprecated or legacy content, add a "Legacy" section at the bottom of `updated-plan.md` or move to a `docs/legacy/` folder.
