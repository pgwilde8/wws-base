To get a trucker to pay **2%**, you have to prove that you are replacing their most expensive headache: **the human dispatcher or the hours they spend staring at load boards.**

Here is the "One-Pager" flyer layout updated to sell the **AI Service** first, followed by the **$CANDLE Reward** second.

---

## **[ LOGO: GREEN CANDLE DISPATCH ]**

### **"The AI Dispatcher That Pays You Back"**

---

**HEADLINE: QUIT SEARCHING. START DRIVING. 🚛**
**Sub-headline:** Focus on the road. Let our AI handle the office. Only 2% per load—and we give most of it back.

---

### **WHAT YOUR 2% GETS YOU (The AI Advantage):**

* **🤖 24/7 AI Load Scanning:** Our AI monitors every major load board (DAT, Truckstop, and more) every second. It finds the high-paying freight before you even wake up.
* **📧 Automated Negotiation:** Our AI "Agent" emails brokers instantly, negotiates for the best RPM (Rate Per Mile) based on your history, and secures the rate con.
* **📑 Paperwork on Autopilot:** We handle the Carrier Packets, Insurance Certs, and BOLs. Just drive—the office work is done.
* **💰 Instant Invoicing:** The moment you upload the POD, our AI generates the invoice and triggers your factoring payment. No more waiting weeks for a check.

### **THE "GREEN CANDLE" DIFFERENCE (The Rewards):**

**We don’t just take a fee—we build your retirement.**

| **The Service** | **The Kickback** | **The Result** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AI Dispatching** | **75% of your fee** | Goes into your locked **$CANDLE** savings stash. |
| **Market Growth** | **25% of your fee** | Is **BURNED** to increase the value of your stash. |

---

### **HOW IT WORKS (Simple 3-Step):**

1. **LINK YOUR BOARD:** Connect your favorite load boards to the Green Candle App.
2. **SET YOUR PREFERENCES:** Tell the AI your preferred lanes, minimum RPM, and home time.
3. **HAUL & EARN:** The AI books the load. You haul it. Your **$CANDLE** stash grows automatically.

### **THE GOAL: YOUR UNLOCKED UPay CARD**

After 6 months of elite AI dispatching, your **Green Candle Debit Card** arrives. Spend your accumulated rewards on fuel, maintenance, or your next vacation.

**"The only dispatch service that wants to see your bank account grow as fast as your odometer."**

### **Why this sells:**

* **Value Proposition:** You aren't just a "token project." You are a **productivity tool**. 2% is a steal for 24/7 AI negotiation (human dispatchers usually charge 5%–10%).
* **The "No-Brainer":** When they see they get 75% back in $CANDLE, they realize they are basically getting professional AI dispatching for an **effective rate of 0.5%**.
* **Language:** Using terms like "Rate Con," "RPM," and "POD" proves you know their world.

**Would you like me to refine the "Automated Negotiation" section to explain exactly how the AI talks to brokers for them?**

### **Design Notes for the Truck Stop Environment:**

* **Color Palette:** Use your "Green Candle" branding prominently. High-contrast colors (e.g., vibrant green on dark grey/black) will stand out.
* **Font:** Easy-to-read, bold fonts. Avoid anything too thin or overly decorative.
* **Durability:** Consider printing on slightly thicker, perhaps even laminated, paper if you're leaving them out.
* **Visuals:** That trucker image is key. It creates instant relatability.
* **QR Code:** Make it large and clear. Truckers will scan with their phones.
* **Simplicity:** Minimal text, maximum impact. They should "get it" in 10-15 seconds.

This flyer gets straight to the point: **"You make money, we burn tokens to make your money worth more, and you get a cool card to spend it."** It hits all the key points we've discussed.

Here is a clean, high-impact **Earnings Calculator** table you can use in your pitch decks, on your website, or in your SaaS app to show drivers exactly why the **75/25 split** is a win for them.

### **The $CANDLE Driver Rewards Table**

*Based on a 2% Network Fee: 75% Rebated to you, 25% Burned to boost token value.*

| Load Value | 2% Network Fee | **Your $CANDLE Rebate (75%)** | **The Burn (25%)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **$1,500** (Short Haul) | $30 | **$22.50** | $7.50 |
| **$3,000** (Mid Haul) | $60 | **$45.00** | $15.00 |
| **$5,000** (Long Haul) | $100 | **$75.00** | $25.00 |

---

### **Projected 6-Month "Trucker Stash"**

If you haul **$12,000 in gross revenue per month** (average for a busy owner-operator):

| Timeframe | Total Fees Paid | **Your $CANDLE Balance** | **Total Supply Burned** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1 Month** | $240 | **$180** | $60 |
| **3 Months** | $720 | **$540** | $180 |
| **6 Months (UNLOCK)** | $1,440 | **$1,080*** | $360 |

> **Note:** *$1,080 is the base value. If the $CANDLE token price increases due to the 25% burn and market adoption, your stash could be worth significantly more when you unlock your **UPay Card**.*

---

### **The Pitch to the Driver**

When you show them this table, focus on these three points:

1. **"Stop Paying, Start Saving":** You aren't "losing" 2%. You are moving 1.5% of your pay into a high-growth crypto savings account and using the other 0.5% to make that account more valuable.
2. **"The Green Candle Effect":** Every single load you haul burns tokens. You are literally making your own rewards more valuable just by doing your job.
3. **"The Exit Strategy":** At Month 6, that $1,080 (or more) goes straight onto your **UPay Debit Card**. Use it for a new set of tires, a weekend off, or just to top off your fuel tank for free.

### **Why this works for the "Grit" narrative:**

It turns the driver from a "worker" into a **"shareholder"** in the network. They aren't just driving for a dispatch service; they are building a position in an asset ($CANDLE) that they control.
