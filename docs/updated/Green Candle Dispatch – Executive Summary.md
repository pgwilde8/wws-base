Green Candle Dispatch – Executive Summary
February 2026
The trucking industry — especially for independent owner-operators — remains one of the last major sectors still heavily reliant on manual processes, opaque fee structures, and slow communication. Drivers lose hours daily searching load boards, negotiating rates via phone/email, chasing paperwork, and dealing with dispatchers who take 8–15% cuts while providing little visibility into the money flow.
Green Candle Dispatch changes this.
We built an AI-powered dispatch platform that:

Automatically scans load boards (DAT, Truckstop) via Chrome extension
Uses GPT-4o to draft and auto-respond to broker negotiations (targeting +$300–500 above initial offers)
Handles paperwork, factoring packet sending, and BOL parsing
Charges only a flat 2% dispatch fee (collected post-factoring) — far below industry norms
Returns 21.05% of that fee immediately as internal service credits ($CANDLE credits) that drivers use to “fuel” automation features (e.g., 0.5 credits per negotiation, 10 credits for full autonomous dispatch)

Every completed load generates real revenue → real credits for drivers → real profit for the platform → automatic buy-and-burn of the separate $CANDLE community token.
Key differentiators:

Transparency: Full “Driver Settlement Ledger” shows every dollar in/out, every fee, every credit — no more guessing or “nickel-and-diming”.
Low cost: 2% vs 10%+ traditional dispatch.
Real utility: Internal credits power daily automation — drivers net positive credits even in heavy usage.
Sustainable tokenomics: The real $CANDLE token (on Base) benefits from 10% of platform profits being used to buy and permanently burn tokens weekly — tying scarcity directly to trucking revenue growth, without any promises of profit or revenue sharing to holders.

We are currently in NJ beta (first 20–50 owner-operators), with factoring webhook integration and automated scouting on the near-term roadmap. National expansion follows in 2026.
$CANDLE token launch (planned Q2–Q3 2026):

Fair launch on Uniswap (Base)
Deflationary mechanism: 10% platform profit → buy $CANDLE → burn
Utility: Community governance + ecosystem perks (not required for app use)
Strict separation: Internal credits remain non-transferable app points; real token is for supporters/investors

Green Candle is building infrastructure — not speculation.
Real freight moves → real revenue → real burns → sustainable deflation.
We invite early supporters, drivers, and investors who believe in fixing trucking dispatch to join us.
The Problem in Trucking Dispatch
The average owner-operator in the United States earns a living in one of the most fragmented, inefficient, and opaque logistics environments still in existence in 2026.
Pain point 1 – Load discovery & lost opportunities
Drivers spend 2–4 hours per day manually scrolling DAT, Truckstop, and other load boards. They miss high-paying loads because they’re sleeping, driving, or simply can’t keep up with thousands of new postings. Many accept lowball offers out of desperation.
Pain point 2 – Negotiation is slow and emotional
Once a load looks promising, the driver (or dispatcher) must call or email the broker — often multiple rounds — to fight for better rates. This takes time, energy, and emotional labor. Many drivers accept $0.30–$0.80/mile below market because they don’t have data or leverage.
Pain point 3 – Paperwork & factoring delays
After booking, drivers chase Rate Con, BOL, and proof-of-delivery documents. Factoring companies take days (sometimes weeks) to fund — leaving drivers cash-flow constrained. Dispatchers frequently add 8–15% fees with little visibility into the math.
Pain point 4 – Opaque money flow & trust issues
Drivers frequently feel “nickel-and-dimed.” They receive a text saying “got you $2,500,” but have no easy way to verify the broker paid $2,800, the dispatcher took $280, and factoring took another cut. Year-end tax prep is a nightmare — scattered PDFs and no centralized record.
Pain point 5 – High dispatch fees for low value
Traditional dispatch services charge 8–15% per load for what is often just phone calls and basic admin. Drivers keep less while bearing most of the risk (deadhead miles, breakdowns, slow-pay brokers).
These frictions cost the average owner-operator thousands of dollars per month in lost earnings, wasted time, and unnecessary fees — while the industry as a whole suffers from low retention and high turnover.
Green Candle Dispatch was built by people who have lived these problems — to fix them at the root.
Our Solution (AI dispatch + transparency)
Green Candle Dispatch is an autonomous AI dispatch platform that puts control, transparency, and more earnings back in the hands of owner-operators.
1. AI-Powered Load Discovery & Negotiation

Chrome extension scans DAT, Truckstop and other boards in real time whenever the driver is browsing (no always-on server scraping required).
Loads are analyzed for profitability against driver-set criteria (preferred lanes, minimum $/mile — default $2.45).
When a strong match appears, the AI Negotiation Agent drafts professional counter-offer emails (+$300–500 target) using GPT-4o and auto-pilot logic:
Accept if offer meets target
Counter if above floor but below target
Escalate to driver if below floor

Broker database (25,000+ entries with MC#, emails, phones) enables fast, accurate routing.

2. End-to-End Automation

One-click factoring packet generation and sending
AI parses uploaded BOLs and invoices
Rate Confirmation detection triggers full autonomous booking credit deduction (10 credits)

3. Radical Transparency – The Driver Settlement Ledger
Every load creates a clear timeline in the app:

Load won → pending income
Dispatch fee taken (exactly 2%)
Factoring funded → driver received amount
Internal $CANDLE credits issued (21.05% rebate — immediate use)
Credits spent on automation (0.3–10 per action)

Drivers see lifetime earnings, total fuel credits earned, and can export tax-ready CSVs + BOLs. No more mystery math.
4. Fair Economics

Flat 2% dispatch fee (post-factoring)
21.05% of fee returned instantly as internal service credits (1 credit = $1 app value)
Drivers net positive credits in normal use — automation becomes cheaper the more they drive
Platform profit funds 10% weekly buy-and-burn of the separate $CANDLE community token

Result:
Drivers save hours daily, negotiate better rates, reduce admin burden, gain full visibility, and keep more money — all for one of the lowest fees in the industry.
Green Candle is not just another dispatch tool — it’s becoming the transparent, AI-native infrastructure layer for independent trucking.
