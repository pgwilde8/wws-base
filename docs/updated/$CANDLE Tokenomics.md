# $CANDLE Tokenomics: Sustainable Support for Green Candle Dispatch

**Last Updated:** February 17, 2026  
**Overview:** $CANDLE is a community-driven token on Base, designed to support the Green Candle ecosystem. It features deflationary mechanics tied to platform revenue, without direct ties to driver rewards. Internal app credits (also called $CANDLE) are separate utility points — not the token.

## Key Principles
- **Deflationary via Real Revenue**: 10% of platform profits (from dispatch fees, call packs, automation sales, factoring referrals) buys and burns $CANDLE — reducing supply as the app grows.
- **Community Focus**: No promises of profit; value from network effects and scarcity.
- **SEC-Aware Design**: Pure utility (governance, perks) — no staking yields or revenue shares to avoid securities classification (per Howey Test).

## Token Details
- **Chain**: Base (EVM-compatible, low fees).
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 $CANDLE.
- **Contract Address**: [TBD — post-launch].
- **Distribution**:
  | Allocation | Percentage | Details |
  |------------|------------|---------|
  | Liquidity Pool | 50% | Seeded on Uniswap for fair trading. |
  | Team/Founders | 20% | Vested over 3 years (cliff + linear). |
  | Community Airdrops/Marketing | 15% | For early supporters and beta users (opt-in). |
  | Treasury (Burns/Buybacks) | 10% | For ongoing deflation. |
  | Advisors/Partners | 5% | Locked for 1 year. |

## Mechanics
- **Buy & Hold**: Available on DEX (Uniswap). No presale — fair launch.
- **Utility**:
  - Governance: Vote on app features (e.g., new AI tools).
  - Perks: Exclusive access (e.g., beta features, community events).
- **Burn/Buyback**:
  - **Trigger**: Weekly from 10% platform profits (e.g., $9k/mo at scale → $9k $CANDLE bought/burned).
  - **Process**: Treasury wallet swaps USDC/ETH → $CANDLE → burns to dead address (0x...dead).
  - **Impact**: Ties token value to real trucking revenue growth (RWA-inspired, without securities risks).
- **No Driver Rewards**: Drivers earn internal credits for app use (immediate, non-transferable). They can buy $CANDLE on DEX to support us voluntarily.

## Projections (Example at Scale)
- 500 Drivers: ~$90k/mo profit → $9k/mo burn (reduces supply by ~0.9% yearly, assuming $1/token).
- Transparency: All burns tracked on-chain + app dashboard.

## Risks & Disclaimers
- Not investment advice. No profit guarantees.
- Consult legal experts for your jurisdiction.
- Subject to change based on community votes.
