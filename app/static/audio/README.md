# Notification sounds

Add a short audio file here so drivers hear a ping when a new notification arrives (e.g. Load Won).

- **File name:** `ping.mp3`
- **Suggested:** 0.5–1.5 seconds; cash-register, sonar ping, or subtle chime.
- Browsers may block autoplay until the user has interacted with the page (e.g. tapped once).
