			<p>My name is Paul G Wilde, and I didn't start my career behind a desk. I started it in the <strong class="text-emerald-300">U.S. Navy</strong>, serving in <strong class="text-emerald-300">VA-196</strong> as an Aviation Structural Maintenance specialist. I spent my days ensuring our aircraft were mission-ready, learning the value of precision, discipline, and hard work.</p>
			
			<p>After the Navy, I traded the flight deck for the open road. I earned my <strong class="text-emerald-300">CDL</strong> and spent time behind the wheel for <strong class="text-emerald-300">Prime, CRST, and Panther</strong>. I've seen the long nights, the missed holidays, and the frustration of dealing with brokers who don't understand what it's like to be 80,000 lbs deep in a winter storm.</p>

		<p class="text-gray-300 text-lg">I built <strong class="text-emerald-300">Green Candle Dispatch</strong> because the industry is broken. Human dispatchers take too much, brokers keep too much, and the driver is always the last one to get paid. I decided to use my skills as a software developer to build a system that works <em>for</em> you, not off you.</p>
